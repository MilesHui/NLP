## Financial_data_sentiment_analysis
Now that BERT based models are getting matured and easy to use thanks to Huggingface implementation and many pre-trained models have been made public. Goal is to see if this latest development in NLP reaches a good level to use in my domain. In this post, I compare different models on a rather simple task of the sentiment analysis on financial texts as a baseline to judge if itâ€™s worth trying another R&D in a real solution.

## Ticker_pseudo_labeling
The assumption is that the higher the sentiment score, the higher the probability of realizing a positive return. Based on this assumption, we automatically collect a large amount of labelled dataset for training the sentiment classification model. 

## Tweets_analysis
Some interesting projects to analyze comuunities, time series, tweet clustering and retweet networks
